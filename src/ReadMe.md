# Virtual Pet Overview

Greetings from Albus the Alpaca!

This interactive games features 7 instance variables which represent different states of Albus.
The 7 states allow you to interact with Albus by tending to his needs.
The states are as follows:
-hunger
-thirst
-boredom
-energy
-sick
-bathroom
-temperature

And accordingly, you interact with him by:
-feeding
-giving water
-playing
-nap time
-tending
-letting him out
-giving a hair cut

When you choose to play with Albus:
-play fetch
-go for a jog
-play soccer (he's really good. I think it's the 4 legs...)

Albus can talk and he lets you know when he needs things.
I've never met a needier Alpaca.

He's also self-sufficient, but only when absolutely necessary.

Albus is Mister Personality!

Play with him and see how long it takes for him to rub you the wrong way.
